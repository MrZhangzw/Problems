'''
The 'pygame' cannot be installed successfully under Python3.9.1_alpha.
I don't know whether it's the problem of compatibility or not.

I have already upgrated my pip and setuptools, but the terminal still gives me an ERROR Message:
    ERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1: python setup.py egg_info Check the logs for full command output.
